# Coastal Sealine Prediction using LSTM in Google Earth Engine

This project demonstrates the changes in the coastal sealine predicted using the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model, and integrates these predictions into Google Earth Engine (GEE) elevation maps. The study area is the Krishna-Godavari Delta, and it includes an interactive interface where users can view predicted changes from the year 2000 to 2100.

## Features
- **Study Area:** Krishna-Godavari Delta
- **Time Slider:** Allows users to adjust the slider from the year 2000 to 2100 to view the predicted sealine changes.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Predicted changes in the coastal sealine due to sea-level rise are displayed as users adjust the slider.

## Google Earth Engine Interface

This project utilizes the Google Earth Engine platform to visualize the predicted coastal sealine changes. The link to the interactive map hosted on Google Earth Engine is available below. Users can adjust the time slider to visualize the changes from 2000 to 2100.

## Link to Project

You can view and interact with the sea-level rise simulation using the following link:

[Sea-Level Rise Simulator on Google Earth Engine](https://ee-vijaydheerajkollati.projects.earthengine.app/view/sea-level-rise-simulator)

## How to Use
1. Open the provided Google Earth Engine link.
2. Use the time slider to adjust the year between 2000 and 2100.
3. Observe the changes in the coastal sealine for the Krishna-Godavari Delta as the year progresses.

## Installation and Setup (if applicable)

If you'd like to run the code locally, or if you're interested in contributing to the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/coastal-sealine-prediction.git
cd coastal-sealine-prediction
