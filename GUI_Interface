# Coastal Sea Level Prediction and Visualization

This project aims to predict the changes in the coastal shoreline using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and visualize these changes on Google Earth Engine (GEE) elevation maps. The study area focuses on the Krishna-Godavari Delta region in India. The interface allows users to interactively explore sea-level rise predictions by adjusting a slider ranging from the year 2000 to 2100, displaying the differences in elevation maps over time.

## Project Overview

Using machine learning models, specifically LSTM, this project predicts the changes in the coastline due to sea level rise. The predictions are then embedded into Google Earth Engine (GEE) maps for visualization. This allows users to examine the impacts of sea-level rise on the region from the present time (2000) to the year 2100.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface**: The application provides an interactive interface where users can adjust the timeline slider to view sea-level rise predictions from the year 2000 to 2100.
- **Study Area**: The focus area for the simulation is the Krishna-Godavari Delta region in India.
- **Sea Level Rise Visualization**: The predicted sea-level changes are overlaid on GEE's elevation maps, allowing users to explore and assess the impact of rising sea levels on the coastal region.
